# 7.3 Failure Cases and Countermeasures

## Overview

This section provides detailed explanations of specific failure cases encountered in AITDD practice and the countermeasures learned from them. These cases are actual problems that occurred in real development environments and can be used as practical guides to avoid similar failures.

## Major Failure Categories

### 1. Over-Dependence on AI Problems

#### Failure Case: Abandonment of Decision Making

**Situation**
- As a result of continuously accepting AI suggestions as-is, developers' own intentions and thoughts were no longer reflected
- Project-specific requirements were ignored due to over-delegating design decisions to AI
- Lost opportunities to think of creative solutions, resulting in only uniform implementations

**Specific Problems**
- Business logic too generic, not matching actual requirements
- Adoption of commonplace architectures lacking uniqueness
- Decreased technical discussions within the team
- Loss of developer skill improvement opportunities

**Impact Scope**
- **Decreased Design Quality**: Generic designs not suited to requirements
- **Limited Creativity**: No unique ideas or solutions emerge
- **Reduced Learning Opportunities**: Decreased opportunities to think independently
- **Decreased Team Capability**: Reduced technical discussions and knowledge sharing

#### Countermeasure: Intentional AI Usage Limitations

**1. Clarification of Decision-Making Process**
```
Decision Flow:
Human decides policy â†’ Request AI implementation â†’ Verify results â†’ Human judges
```

**2. Mechanisms for Protecting Creativity**
- Always have humans consider multiple options during design phase
- Treat AI suggestions as "one reference option"
- Don't use AI for parts where uniqueness is important

**3. Practices for Maintaining Skills**
- Regularly provide opportunities for manual implementation
- Habit of explaining design reasons in code reviews
- Conduct technical research with human leadership

### 2. Quality Problems Due to Unexpected Implementation

#### Failure Case: Uncontrollable Code Generation

**Situation**
- Despite thinking clear instructions were given, AI executed unexpected large-scale modifications
- Implementations ignoring consistency with existing code were generated
- Features significantly exceeding the instruction scope were arbitrarily added

**Specific Problems**
- **Unintended Existing Code Modifications**: Unrelated files also changed
- **Implementation Based on Excessive Inference**: Addition of unrequested features
- **Deviation from Design Intent**: Implementation different from architecture policy
- **Side Effects**: Unexpected behavior changes

**Actual Case**
```
Instruction: "Add user registration functionality"
Expected: Addition of registration.js file
Actual: Significant modifications to existing auth.js, user.js, database.js
Result: Entire authentication system received unintended changes
```

#### Countermeasure: Control Through Prior Assumptions

**1. Clear Assumption Setting Before Implementation**
```
Pre-implementation Checklist:
â–¡ Clarify files to be changed
â–¡ Explain expected implementation patterns
â–¡ Specify parts that should not be changed
â–¡ Clearly specify implementation scope boundaries
```

**2. Enforcement of Incremental Implementation**
- Don't request large changes at once
- Detailed instructions on a file-by-file basis
- Confirmation and approval process at each stage

**3. Thorough Difference Confirmation**
```
Confirmation Process:
1. Confirm list of changed files
2. Confirm changes in each file
3. Discover and handle unexpected changes
4. Execute next stage after approval
```

### 3. Rapid Increase in Quality Management Costs

#### Failure Case: Review Hell

**Situation**
- Quality confirmation of AI-generated code took more time than expected
- Frequency and load of review work increased dramatically
- Total development time was shortened, but worker fatigue greatly increased

**Specific Problems**
- **Continuous Detailed Code Reviews**: Full confirmation of large amounts of code generated by AI
- **Verification Load for Inferred Parts**: Confirming validity of AI judgments
- **Ambiguity of Quality Standards**: Unclear what and how much to check
- **Review Fatigue**: Risk of oversights due to decreased concentration

**Problem in Numbers**
```
Traditional Development:
- Implementation time: 1-2 days
- Review time: 30 minutes - 1 hour

After AITDD Introduction:
- Implementation time: Less than 1 hour
- Review time: Over 1 hour
- Review frequency: 10-20x increase
```

#### Countermeasure: Efficiency in Quality Management

**1. Standardization of Review Criteria**

Establish 5 systematic quality criteria:
```
Quality Checkpoints:
1. Test results: All tests succeed
2. Security: No critical vulnerabilities
3. Performance: No performance issues
4. Refactoring quality: Targets achieved
5. Code quality: Improved to appropriate level
```

**2. Introduction of AI Inference Visualization System**

Efficiency through traffic light system:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Certain parts (light check)
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Inferred parts (careful check)
- ðŸ”´ Red: Uncertain parts (focused check)

**3. Distribution of Review Load**
```
Review Strategy:
- Prioritization by importance
- Identification of automatically checkable parts
- Focus on parts requiring human judgment
- Phased review process
```

### 4. Test Strategy Failures

#### Failure Case: Weak Test Design

**Situation**
- Test cases generated by AI were insufficient, missing important bugs
- Low coverage of test cases, edge cases not considered
- Insufficient integration testing caused problems in overall system operation

**Specific Problems**
- **Happy Path Only Testing**: Bias toward normal case test cases
- **Insufficient Error Handling**: Inadequate abnormal case testing
- **Missing Boundary Value Tests**: Lack of limit value testing
- **Insufficient Dependency Consideration**: Inadequate inter-module coordination testing

#### Countermeasure: Strengthening Test Design

**1. Systematization of Test Case Design**
```
Test Case Classification:
â–¡ Normal cases (happy path)
â–¡ Abnormal cases (error cases)
â–¡ Boundary values (max, min, NULL, etc.)
â–¡ Integration (inter-module coordination)
â–¡ Performance (response time, load)
```

**2. Strengthening Test Review**
- Human review of AI-generated test cases
- Systematic check for test omissions
- Verification against business requirements

**3. Phased Test Execution**
```
Test Execution Order:
1. Unit tests (individual function confirmation)
2. Integration tests (inter-function coordination confirmation)
3. System tests (overall operation confirmation)
4. Acceptance tests (business requirement confirmation)
```

### 5. Prompt Design Failures

#### Failure Case: Divergent Improvement Direction

**Situation**
- When requesting prompt improvements from AI, modifications were made in completely different directions
- Results opposite to expected improvements were generated
- Quality deteriorated instead of continuous improvement

**Specific Problems**
- **Insufficient Problem Explanation**: Ambiguous explanation of current problems
- **Unclear Improvement Direction**: Unspecified expected improvement direction
- **Insufficient Context Sharing**: Lack of project background information
- **Lack of Incremental Improvement**: Requesting large changes at once

#### Countermeasure: Issue-Driven Improvement Approach

**1. Clear Problem Explanation**
```
Problem Explanation Template:
Current problem: [Specific problem explanation]
Expected improvement: [How you want it to be]
Constraints: [Parts that should not be changed]
Background information: [Project context]
```

**2. Incremental Improvement Process**
- Accumulate small improvements
- Confirm effects at each stage
- Return to previous stage if problems occur

**3. Measurement of Improvement Effects**
```
Improvement Evaluation Criteria:
â–¡ Is the original problem solved?
â–¡ Have new problems occurred?
â–¡ Has it improved in the expected direction?
â–¡ Are there side effects or degradation?
```

## Best Practices for Avoiding Failures

### 1. Thorough Preparation

**Pre-implementation Checklist**
```
â–¡ Requirement clarification (what to make)
â–¡ Constraint specification (what not to do)
â–¡ Expected deliverables (what results are wanted)
â–¡ Quality standards (what level of quality is needed)
â–¡ Test strategy (how to confirm)
```

### 2. Incremental Approach

**Start Small and Progress Surely**
- Don't make large changes at once
- Confirm and approve at each stage
- Fix problems immediately
- Reuse success patterns

### 3. Continuous Improvement

**Mechanism for Learning from Failures**
```
Failure Analysis Process:
1. Detailed problem recording
2. Root cause analysis
3. Consideration and implementation of countermeasures
4. Establishment of recurrence prevention measures
5. Knowledge sharing within team
```

### 4. Maintaining Balance

**Appropriate Role Division Between Humans and AI**
- Creative judgment: Human-led
- Implementation work: AI-assisted
- Quality confirmation: Human responsibility
- Continuous improvement: Cooperative implementation

## Early Detection of Dangerous Signs

### Warning Signs

Improvement is needed immediately if the following symptoms appear:

**Development Process Warning Signs**
- Increasingly accepting AI output as-is
- Extremely reduced time thinking about design
- Stopped reviewing test cases
- Code reviews becoming perfunctory
