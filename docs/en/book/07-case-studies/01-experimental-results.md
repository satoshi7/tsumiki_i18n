# 7.1 Experimental Project Results

## Overview

Applying the AITDD methodology to small-scale experimental projects achieved dramatic efficiency improvements compared to traditional development methods. This section provides detailed explanations of quantitative results and newly discovered challenges.

## Dramatic Improvement in Development Efficiency

### Changes in Implementation Speed

**Traditional Development Methods**
- Typical implementation time: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)
- Gradual manual implementation process
- Heavily dependent on individual skills

**After AITDD Introduction**
- Implementation time for equivalent functionality: Less than 1 hour
- **Efficiency multiplier: 20-48x improvement**
- Stable results through structured processes

### Characteristics of the Implementation Process

AITDD implementation adopted the following characteristic processes:

- **Automated Execution**: Sequential execution of each step via shell scripts
- **Simplified Time Management**: Natural progression without manual time measurement
- **Quality-Focused**: Prioritizing quality assurance over efficiency
- **Continuous Iteration**: Reliable execution of Red-Green-Refactor-Validation cycles

## Achieving Quality Improvements

### Generating High-Quality Code

- **Refactoring Process**: Achieving high quality through systematic refactoring processes
- **Validation Step**: Quality assurance through comprehensive quality management
- **Test-First**: Robust implementation through pre-designed testing

### Quality Assessment Criteria

Five quality assessment criteria used in actual projects:

1. **Test Results**: All tests continue to pass
2. **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities found
3. **Performance**: No significant performance issues discovered
4. **Refactoring Quality**: Targets achieved
5. **Code Quality**: Improved to appropriate levels

## Discovery of New Challenges

### Fundamental Changes in Work Nature

The introduction of AITDD significantly changed the nature of development work:

**Traditional Work**
- Checking code you wrote yourself with understanding
- Implementation work as the primary focus
- Gradual quality improvement

**Work After AITDD**
- Detailed code review of generated code
- Confirmation and verification work as primary focus
- AI output quality management becomes important

### Increased Quality Management Costs

**New Cost Elements**
- Quality confirmation work for AI-generated code
- Validity verification of inferred parts
- Test case validity confirmation
- Consistency confirmation with design intent

**Typical Problem Patterns**
- **Unintended Existing Code Modifications**: Independent modifications outside instruction scope
- **Implementation Based on Excessive Inference**: Independent judgment beyond instructions
- **Deviation from Design Intent**: Differences between AI interpretation and actual intent

### Work Load Analysis

**Implementation Work Load**: Significant decrease (1-2 days â†’ less than 1 hour)
**Quality Management Work Load**: Significant increase (increased frequency of detailed reviews)
**Overall Work Time**: Approximately 2 hours (reduced to 1/4-1/8 of traditional time)
**Worker Cognitive Load**: Increased fatigue (rapid increase in review frequency)

## Results of Tool Selection

### Effects of Adopting Claude Sonnet 4

**Selection Reasons**
- Superior coding ability compared to other AI tools
- High quality of generated code
- Good compatibility with AITDD processes

**Actual Effects**
- Stable high-quality code generation
- Efficiency through process integration
- Achieving predictable development cycles

## Key Points for Practice

### Success Factors

1. **Structured Process**: Reliable execution of Red-Green-Refactor-Validation
2. **Emphasis on Quality Management**: Attitude of prioritizing quality over efficiency
3. **Appropriate Tool Selection**: Selecting AI tools suitable for the project
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Continuous review and optimization of processes

### Points to Note

1. **Recognition of Quality Management Costs**: Understanding the trade-off between efficiency improvement and quality management costs
2. **Importance of Review Skills**: Review capability for AI-generated code is important
3. **Adapting to Changes in Work Nature**: Role change from implementer to reviewer
4. **Comprehensive Efficiency Evaluation**: Evaluate based on overall development efficiency, not just implementation time

## Future Improvement Directions

### Implemented Improvements

- **AI Inference Visualization System**: Clarification of inferred parts through traffic light system
- **Validation Step**: Establishment of systematic quality confirmation process

### Improvements Under Consideration

- **Adoption of Review AI**: Partial automation of code review work
- **Automation of Check Work**: Streamlining quality management processes
- **Development of Quality Management Tools**: Reducing work load through dedicated tools

## Summary

The results of the AITDD experimental project clearly showed the "light and shadow" of **dramatic improvement in implementation efficiency** (20-48x) and **new challenges in quality management**. These results teach us the importance of appropriate quality management strategies along with the possibilities of AI-assisted development.

**Important Lessons**
- AITDD definitely improves development efficiency
- Increased quality management costs are an unavoidable new reality
- Work nature changes from "creating" to "confirming"
- Comprehensive efficiency evaluation is important

Based on these insights, we aim for further improvements and optimization in the next project.
