# 6.1 Balance Strategy to Avoid Over-Dependence

To effectively utilize AITDD, it's important to maximize AI's capabilities while maintaining developers' creativity and judgment. This section explains practical strategies for appropriate role division between AI and humans and avoiding over-dependence.

## Problems from Over-Dependence on AI

### Key Challenges

One of the biggest challenges in AITDD is that **over-relying on AI makes it difficult to incorporate developers' own will and thinking**. This problem occurs not only with Claude Sonnet 4 but commonly with other AI tools, causing the following impacts:

- **Design Decisions**: Easy to be swayed by AI suggestions, limiting independent judgment
- **Creativity**: Difficult to generate unique ideas and solutions
- **Learning Opportunities**: Reduced opportunities for thinking independently, affecting skill improvement

### Lessons from Vibe Coding

In the development process of AITDD methodology, many experience an early stage called "vibe coding." This is a **coding method using AI with momentum and feeling**, but has been found to have the following limitations:

- One implementation is very fast, but reaches a **limit at around 3 feature integrations**
- AI **generates large amounts of code not instructed**
- **Completely different implementations for the same requirements** are easily created, lacking consistency
- Results in situations where **manual work becomes faster**

## Establishing Appropriate Role Division

### Areas Humans Should Handle

In AITDD, the area where humans should most express creativity is **requirements definition and design**:

#### Most Important Area: Requirements Definition and Design
- **Imaging "what you want to do"** is the greatest point for expressing creativity
- Determining problem-solving directions
- Source of value creation
- Process of converting business requirements to system requirements

#### Human Expertise Areas
- **Goal Setting**: Defining project objectives and success metrics
- **Value Judgments**: Determining feature priorities and quality requirements
- **Creative Thinking**: Proposing new approaches and solutions
- **System-wide Consistency**: Ensuring consistency at the architecture level

### Areas Where AI Excels

Meanwhile, AI can effectively support humans in the following areas:

- **Implementation Support**: Code generation and detailed implementation
- **Quality Improvement**: Test case generation and bug detection
- **Efficiency**: Automation of routine tasks
- **Documentation Generation**: Creating comments and design documents

## Practical Balance Strategies

### 1. Visualizing AI's Inferences

By making AI's decision process transparent, appropriate supervision and correction become possible:

#### Current Efforts
- Marking AI's inferences and completions through prompt design innovations
- Introducing mechanisms to mark content inferred by AI
- Visualizing uncertain decisions

#### Future Development Direction
- Building a complete visualization system for AI inferences
- Reducing the black box problem
- Enabling more precise human supervision

### 2. Clarifying Checkpoints

Clarify what humans should check to enable efficient reviews:

#### Setting Checkpoints
- **Purpose**: Understanding what humans should check
- **Effect**: Achieving efficient reviews
- **Quality**: Preventing oversight of important decisions

#### Specific Check Items
- Whether AI has implemented features not instructed
- Whether implementation methods conform to requirements
- Whether consistency with existing systems is maintained
- Whether future extensibility is considered

### 3. Gradual Improvement Approach

It's important to improve coordination with AI gradually:

#### Improvement Steps
1. **Current**: Recognizing issues and considering solution directions
2. **Next**: Introducing marking mechanisms in prompt design
3. **Future**: Complete visualization system for AI inferences

#### Continuous Adjustment
- Improving methods through practice
- Sharing best practices within teams
- Adapting to new AI tools

## Implementing Balance Strategy

### Role Division in TDD Process

In the Red-Green-Refactor-Validation cycle, clarify the roles of humans and AI at each step:

#### Red Step (Human-Led)
- Defining test requirements and determining design policies
- Designing test case structure and expected values
- Requesting AI to implement test code

#### Green Step (AI-Led with Human Supervision)
- AI generates implementation code
- Humans confirm implementation approach
- Adjusting implementation content as needed

#### Refactor Step (Collaborative)
- Humans determine refactoring policies
- AI handles specific implementation
- Humans judge quality standards

#### Validation Step (Human-Led)
- Setting quality evaluation criteria
- Interpreting AI's verification results
- Final decision on acceptance

### Prompt Design Innovations

Key points for prompt design to achieve effective balance:

```markdown
# Prompt Example (Balance-Focused)
Please implement code based on the following specifications.

## Implementation Requirements
- [Specific requirements]

## Important Constraints
- Match existing code style
- Do not implement additional features based on assumptions

## Output Format
In addition to implementation code, please specify:
- [Inference] Parts inferred from specifications
- [Confirmation] Decision points requiring confirmation
- [Alternatives] Present other implementation methods if available
```

## Expected Effects

By implementing appropriate balance strategies, the following effects can be expected:

### Maintaining and Improving Developer Skills
- Skill retention through appropriate role division between AI and humans
- Securing opportunities for developers to express creativity
- Learning effects through improved AI support transparency

### Efficient Quality Management
- Clarification of important decision points
- Achieving efficient reviews
- Establishing continuous quality assurance processes

### Long-term Development Capability Improvement
- Accumulation of organizational AI utilization capabilities
- Establishing collaborative models between humans and AI
- Building sustainable development processes

## Summary

Balance strategy in AITDD is an important element that reconciles AI efficiency with human creativity. To maximize AI's power while avoiding over-dependence, clear role division and continuous improvement are necessary. The next section will explain specific points for humans to express creativity within this balance.
