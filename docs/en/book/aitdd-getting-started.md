# AITDD Introduction - Understanding AI-Assisted Test-Driven Development in 10 Minutes

## What is AITDD?

AITDD (AI + Test-Driven Development) is a new development methodology that uses AI to enhance the efficiency of test-driven development. By combining the power of AI with traditional TDD, you can dramatically improve development speed while creating high-quality software.

## How It Differs from Traditional Development

### Traditional Development
- Writing code line by line manually
- Consuming significant time on implementation
- Heavy dependence on individual skills

### AITDD
- AI assists with code generation
- Implementation burden is significantly reduced
- High-speed development while ensuring quality through tests

## Basic AITDD Flow

1. **TODO Creation** - Clarify what to build
2. **Specification** - Decide details together with AI
3. **Test Creation** - Express expected behavior through tests
4. **Implementation** - Have AI generate code
5. **Validation** - Human performs final check

By repeating this flow, you can efficiently create reliable software.

## What Projects Is It Suitable For?

### Particularly Effective
- **Projects that write a lot of similar code**
  - CRUD operations
  - API development
  - Form validation
- **JavaScript & Python** projects
  - AI can easily investigate library information

### Requires Caution
- Cases requiring extremely high performance
- Compiled languages like Java & C# (limited effectiveness)

## Tools to Use

### Claude Sonnet 4
- Main AI assistant
- Handles everything from code generation to quality checks
- The key is how to write prompts (instructions)

### Development Environment
- Your usual editor/IDE
- Test execution environment
- Version control (Git)

## Actual Development Example

### Example: Simple Task Management Feature

1. **TODO**: "Create a feature that can add, delete, and change completion status of tasks"

2. **Specification**: Decide details through dialogue with AI
   - Task data structure
   - Required API endpoints
   - Error handling

3. **Test Creation**: Express expected behavior in test code

4. **Implementation**: AI generates code that passes tests

5. **Validation**: Operation confirmation and quality check

## Benefits

- **Development Speed**: Can develop at several times the speed of traditional methods
- **Quality Stability**: Quality assurance through tests
- **Learning Effect**: Learn new technologies from AI-generated code
- **Creativity**: Reduced implementation work allows focus on design

## Points to Note

- **Don't completely depend on AI**: Final decisions are made by humans
- **Prompt Design**: Quality changes based on how you instruct the AI
- **Continuous Improvement**: Improve the process through practice

## 3 Steps to Get Started

### Step 1: Environment Preparation
- Acquire Claude Sonnet 4 account
- Set up development environment

### Step 2: Start Small
- Begin with simple CRUD operations
- Practice writing prompts

### Step 3: Continuous Improvement
- Improve the process through practice
- Share knowledge within the team

## Summary

AITDD is a methodology for efficiently developing high-quality software with the help of AI. Rather than leaving everything to AI, by having humans and AI collaborate, you can achieve speed and quality that were previously unthinkable.

Start with a small project and experience the effects of AITDD for yourself. Through practice, you should discover your own AITDD style.
