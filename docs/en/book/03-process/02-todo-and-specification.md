# 3.2 TODO Creation and Specification Planning

## TODO Creation: The Starting Point of Development

### Importance of TODOs

In AITDD, proper TODO creation is the key to success. Ambiguous TODOs negatively affect all subsequent steps, so it's important to create clear and actionable TODOs.

### Principles of Effective TODO Creation

#### 1. Ensuring Specificity
```markdown
❌ Bad example: "Create user management functionality"
✅ Good example: "Implement user registration functionality (email/password authentication)"
```

#### 2. Appropriate Granularity
- **Too large**: One TODO includes multiple functionalities
- **Too small**: Individual method units
- **Appropriate**: One complete functional unit

#### 3. Clear Completion Criteria
```markdown
## TODO: Implement User Registration API

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Implementation of POST /api/users endpoint
- [ ] Email/password validation
- [ ] Password hashing
- [ ] Database storage
- [ ] Unified response format
```

### TODO Management File Structure

#### Basic Format

```markdown
# Project TODO Management

## Planned Implementation
### High Priority
- [ ] **User Authentication Feature**
  - Description: Authentication feature using JWT authentication
  - Completion criteria: Login/logout/token verification
  - Dependencies: Database design completed

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Product Search Feature**
  - Description: Product search by keyword and category
  - Completion criteria: Search API + filtering functionality

## In Progress
- [x] Database design (completed on 2024-06-21)

## Completed
- [x] Project initial setup (completed on 2024-06-20)
```

#### Recommended File Structure

```
doc/
├── todo.md                    # Main TODO management
├── implementation/
│   ├── user-auth-requirements.md      # Detailed specifications for individual features
│   ├── user-auth-testcases.md         # Test cases
│   └── search-requirements.md
└── archive/
    └── completed-todos.md              # Archive of completed TODOs
```

## Specification Planning: The Foundation of Design

### Purpose of Specification Planning

Develop specific technical specifications from TODOs and clarify the direction of implementation. Ambiguity at this stage becomes a major problem in later steps, so it's important to consider details thoroughly.

### Specification Document Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Requirements Definition Document

## Overview
Briefly describe the purpose and overview of the feature

## Functional Requirements

### Basic Functionality
- Essential basic functionality

### Detailed Specifications
- Input items and validation
- Processing flow
- Output format

### Non-functional Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Availability requirements

## Technical Specifications

### API Specifications
- Endpoints
- Request/response format
- Status codes

### Database Design
- Table design
- Indexes
- Constraints

### Error Handling
- Error case definitions
- Error messages
- Log output policy

## Constraints
- Technical constraints
- Business constraints
- External dependencies

## Reference Materials
- Related documents
- External API specifications
```

### Specific Specification Planning Example

#### Example: User Registration Feature Specification

```markdown
# User Registration Feature Requirements Definition Document

## Overview
Feature that allows new users to register with email and password

## Functional Requirements

### Basic Functionality
- New user registration with email/password
- Duplicate email verification
- Password strength check

### Detailed Specifications

#### Input Items
- **email**: Required, email format, maximum 254 characters
- **password**: Required, 8+ characters, include alphanumeric symbols
- **password_confirmation**: Required, must match password

#### Validation
- Email duplication check (database confirmation)
- Password strength (include uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols)
- CSRF token verification

#### Processing Flow
1. Input value validation
2. Email duplication check
3. Password hashing (bcrypt)
4. Database storage
5. Return success response

### Non-functional Requirements
- Response time: Within 2 seconds
- Concurrent registration: Support up to 100 cases/second
- Password hashing mandatory

## Technical Specifications

### API Specifications
```
POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json

Request:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "password_confirmation": "SecurePass123!"
}

Response (201):
{
  "id": 123,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-06-21T10:00:00Z"
}

Response (400):
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Email already exists"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Database Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(254) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### Error Handling
- **400**: Validation error, duplicate email
- **429**: Rate limiting
- **500**: Server error

## Constraints
- Password plain text storage prohibited
- Email confirmation feature not included this time
- Social login not included this time
```

## Human Review Points

### Check Items

#### 1. Completeness Confirmation
- [ ] Are all necessary features included?
- [ ] Are edge cases considered?
- [ ] Is error handling sufficient?

#### 2. Feasibility Verification
- [ ] Is it technically implementable?
- [ ] Are performance requirements realistic?
- [ ] Are security requirements appropriate?

#### 3. Consistency Confirmation
- [ ] Consistency with other features
- [ ] Data design consistency
- [ ] API interface uniformity

#### 4. Maintainability Consideration
- [ ] Future extensibility
- [ ] Ease of testing
- [ ] Ease of documentation

### Review Precautions

#### Precautions When Using AI Suggestions
- Use AI suggestions as reference
- Final decisions must always be made by humans
- Project-specific requirements added by humans

#### Gradual Detailing
```
1. Overview-level specification → Review
2. Add detailed specifications → Review
3. Establish technical specifications → Review
4. Final confirmation → Approval
```

## Best Practices for Specification Planning

### 1. Clear, Unambiguous Expression
```markdown
❌ "Process appropriately"
✅ "Return 400 status code and error message on error"
```

### 2. Specify Concrete Numbers
```markdown
❌ "Process at high speed"
✅ "Return response within 2 seconds"
```

### 3. Clarify Constraints
```markdown
❌ "Consider security"
✅ "Hash passwords with bcrypt, plain text storage prohibited"
```

### 4. Consider Testability
- Confirm each specification item is testable
- Consider test data preparation methods
- Consider necessity of mocks and stubs

## Preparation for Next Step

After specification planning is completed, proceed to [Test Case Creation](./03-test-case-creation.md).

### Deliverable Confirmation
- [ ] TODO.md is properly updated
- [ ] requirements.md is created in detail
- [ ] No ambiguous parts remain in specifications
- [ ] Human review is completed

### Common Problems and Countermeasures

#### Specifications remain ambiguous
**Countermeasure**: Always implement human review and resolve questions on the spot

#### Excessive dependence on AI suggestions
**Countermeasure**: Keep AI suggestions as reference only, final decisions made by humans

#### Non-functional requirements are missed
**Countermeasure**: Systematic review using checklists

Proper specification planning ensures smooth test case creation and implementation thereafter.
