# 3.5 Validation Step Details

## Positioning of the Validation Step

The Validation step is one of the most important innovations in AITDD. Added to the traditional TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle, this step automates quality assurance and completion determination for AI-generated code, enabling a more reliable development process.

## Purpose of the Validation Step

### 1. Multi-layered Quality Assurance
- **Functional requirement fulfillment**: Planned features are correctly implemented
- **Regression prevention**: No adverse effects on existing features
- **Code quality**: Maintainable, high-quality code is generated

### 2. Automated Completion Determination
- Completion determination based on objective criteria
- Pre-filtering before human review
- Continuous quality monitoring

### 3. Process Improvement Feedback
- Understanding quality trends in AI-generated code
- Information collection for prompt improvement
- Measurement and optimization of development efficiency

## Specific Work Procedures

### 1. Confirming Green State of Existing Tests

#### Prerequisites
All existing tests must be passing as a prerequisite.

```bash
# Test execution
$ npm test

# Expected results
‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Ä∫ should login with valid credentials
‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Ä∫ should reject invalid password  
‚úÖ User Registration ‚Ä∫ should create user with valid data
‚úÖ User Registration ‚Ä∫ should reject duplicate email
‚úÖ Product Management ‚Ä∫ should create product
‚úÖ Product Management ‚Ä∫ should list products

Tests: 6 passed, 6 total
Time: 2.341s
Coverage: 94%
```

#### Response to Failures
```markdown
‚ùå Response when test failures exist

1. Identify failure causes
   - Impact on existing features from new implementation
   - Test data conflicts
   - Environment-dependent issues

2. Implement fixes
   - Fix problematic code
   - Adjust test data
   - Review environment settings

3. Confirm through re-execution
   - Re-run all tests
   - Continue Validation after confirming success
```

```

## AI Determination Process

### 1. Information Collection and Analysis

#### Input Information
```markdown
## Input Data During Validation Execution

- requirements.md (functional and non-functional requirements)
- testcases.md (test case list)
- architecture.md (architecture design)

### Project Information
- Existing codebase
- Dependency information
- Environment configuration
```

#### Analysis Methods
```markdown
## AI Analysis Approach

### 1. Quantitative Analysis
- Calculate test case implementation rate
- Evaluate code coverage
- Measure complexity metrics
- Check performance indicators

### 2. Qualitative Analysis  
- Check consistency between requirements and implementation
- Subjective evaluation of code quality
- Check security requirements
- Evaluate maintainability

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Impact analysis of unimplemented features
- Security risk evaluation
- Operational risk evaluation
- Technical debt evaluation
```

### 2. Determination Logic

#### Hierarchical Determination System
```markdown
## Determination Priority

### Level 1: Critical Issues (Immediate continuation determination)
1. Existing test failures
2. Critical security issues
3. Data corruption risk

### Level 2: Missing Important Features (Continuation recommended)
1. Basic feature not implemented
2. Important error handling missing
3. Required validation missing

### Level 3: Quality Standards (Threshold-based determination)
1. Test coverage < 80%
2. Test case implementation rate < 90%
3. Complexity > tolerance value

### Level 4: Comprehensive Determination (Complete/Continue/Requires judgment)
- Final determination integrating all above
- Check against organizational quality standards
- Consider project circumstances
```

#### Example Determination Prompt
```markdown

```

## Traffic Light System for Inference Visualization

### Utilizing the Traffic Light System

The Validation step visualizes AI inference parts to improve human review efficiency.

#### üü¢ Green Light (High Confidence)
```markdown
## Content Clearly Inferable from Source Files

### Example: Test Case Implementation Status
- üü¢ TC001 implemented (corresponding test exists in test file)
- üü¢ Basic functionality verified (test success results available)
- üü¢ Error handling implemented (specified in requirements document)
```

#### üü° Yellow Light (Caution - Requires Confirmation)
```markdown  
## Content Supplemented by Inference but Seems Valid

### Example: Quality Determination
- üü° 80% code coverage is sufficient (judgment based on general standards)
- üü° Performance requirements unmeasured but no issues (inferred from implementation)
- üü° Medium security risk (estimated from unimplemented rate limiting)
```

#### üî¥ Red Light (Requires Verification)
```markdown
## Content Not in Source Files Based on Independent Judgment

### Example: Business Decisions
- üî¥ Rate limiting implementation priority "medium" (organizational policy unknown)
- üî¥ DB connection error handling required (operational requirements unconfirmed)
- üî¥ Next phase implementation sufficient (project schedule unknown)
```

### Management in TODO Format

```markdown
## Validation Result TODO

### üü¢ High Confidence Items (Confirmation Recommended)
- [ ] Confirm TC001-007 implementation completion in [testcases.md](./testcases.md)
- [ ] Confirm 100% basic feature implementation in [requirements document](./requirements.md)

### üü° Medium Confidence Items (Requires Confirmation)
- [ ] Check performance characteristics of [implementation code](./src/users.js)
- [ ] Check compliance with [security requirements](./requirements.md)

### üî¥ Requires Judgment Items (Important)
- [ ] Detailed check: Determine implementation priority of [unimplemented items](./testcases.md) by organizational standards
- [ ] Detailed check: Confirm DB failure requirements in [operational requirements](./requirements.md)
- [ ] Detailed check: Adjust implementation plan based on project schedule
```
